## Inheritance

Inheritance is a very useful ability of `children` elements to get the same property in default as his parent does have (to 'inherit' it).

### Main properties' inheritance:
* styles
* parents
* parent's styles
* defaults

### Reference properties' inheritance:
* styles
* prototypes
* parents
* parent's styles
* defaults
